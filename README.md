# NBPreview

NBPreview is a [IPython](http://ipython.org/)/[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook previewer. It does not require an internet connection, or even having IPython/Jupyter installed.

You can use [__this hosted version__](https://jsvine.github.io/nbpreview/) or `git clone` your own. Just drag-and-drop your `.ipynb` file onto the filepicker, and *voilà!*

## Running Your Own NBPreview

To run NBPreview on your own computer, clone or [download](archive/master.zip) this repository, and then open `index.html`.

Alternatively, you can run a local server by executing `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in the `nbpreview` directory, after which you can visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## MathJax

NBPreview doesn't come packaged with support for MathJax (so that, by default, NBPreview doesn't connect to any third-party servers), but it's easy to add. In `index.html`'s `<head>` tag, insert:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
MathJax.Hub.Config({
    tex2jax: {
        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],
        displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],
        processEscapes: true,
        processEnvironments: true
    },
    displayAlign: 'center',
    "HTML-CSS": {
        styles: {'.MathJax_Display': {"margin": 0}},
        linebreaks: { automatic: true }
    }
});
</script>
```
